ModCLI Documentation

This command line interface is designed to provide a quick and efficient way to interact with the Turntable.fm room moderation tools through the chat text input box. Commands with proper syntax will be processed without being sent to Turntable's server and being displayed in the chat window for others to see.

When using commands that require names for arguments, keep in mind you can use the auto-complete functionality built into the user interface, however names that start with an '@' must be represented with double '@'s when entering them in the input box. See examples below.
